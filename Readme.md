# Anvesh
A fast and efficient meta-search engine built in rust.

This was built as an experiment to see how a meta-search engine can be built. I
might work on this for a bit but I don't really see any usecase for a meta search engine.

A lot of parts are not polished, the UI is pretty bare bones.

### Running 
Clone the repo and run `cargo run` to compile and run the application.
